This document briefly explains the commands set in the codeshelf-rules.mkr file

==========================
Register:	9D
Value:		0
Description:

Set target tolerance of scanner to 0. This means that the
barcode must be perfectly centered in the targeting light
to be scanned. This value has been choosen to reduce scanning
errors on packages and on the command card.

==========================
Register:	7A
Value:		0xffffffff
Description:

Set the last known good bluetooth address to an invalid
address (0xffffffff). When the scanner boots it will see
this address as invalid and will not attempt to reconnect.
This keeps the scanner from unintentionally connecting to
a cart (the last one it was connected to).
